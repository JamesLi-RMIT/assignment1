I go by James since I am a big fan of the James Bond movies. I am currently a bachelor student of Mechanical Engineering at UNSW and I will be getting my degree at the end of 2022, the picture above shows a robotic hand that was done with my teammates when I was in year one. My cultural background is Chinese, both Cantonese and Mandarina are my mother tongue, I also speak fluent English and some Deutsch. I came to Australia when I was 17 and decided to stay in Sydney because I am amazed by the Harbour Views and those picturesque beaches. One of my favourite things to do is building Lego, I had almost 30 sets of Lego collections, most of them are Technic Sets like vehicle, cranes, trucks, excavators, loaders. Some of them include real-life function such as using a gearbox and steering system. 


Interest in IT

My real interest in IT is the way it changes human lifestyle in a more convenient way and also helps business to grow faster using all kinds of advanced technologies and new ideas.  When I got my first full time job in 2019, I was working in a pharmaceutical delivery company, my role was getting pharmacies onboard to ensure them correctly using our portal. Just like Uber-eat, our mobile application can dispatch orders from customers to different chemist stores based on client’s delivery location and delivery to door. In addition, some of medicines need a doctor’s prescription which means patients have to go to physical store to buy them, while our app can forward patient’s electronic script straight to their local chemist so that they don’t need to leave home. This is my experience of knowing how technology can help not only individuals, also those pharmacies who wants to boost their business.

The reason I choose RMIT because it offers a complete online course study throughout the whole degree and there are a lot of online resources for me to read and study. Lectures and tutorials are at night so that I can work at daytime.

Throughout this course, I expect to develop an understanding of different information systems and what are the modern technologies that are commonly used in daily life and how do they help business solve problems.

Whether we are at work or on a public transport or sitting at home watching televisions, brands are everywhere and affect our lives, however, not always can we recognise a brand because there are too many of them out there, my idea for this IT project is to create an application that is able to help users to learn more about a specific brand they don’t know. This App will list all the articles, information and news about the manufacture and brand related history to the product. 

Motivation
People loving shopping and buying new things, I believe this tool will be useful for majority of people. 
 
Description
By scanning the logo or the tag of an item, the app will automatically load up any related information about the brand, user can save and share it with friends. 

Skills Required
Programming in JavaScript, Python and Swift
